Rokto is a web-based platform that connects individuals in urgent need of fresh blood with willing donors. Unlike traditional blood banks that rely on stored or frozen blood, Rokto focuses on facilitating direct, real-time connections during emergencies. The platform's vision is to build a life-saving platform where no one loses their life due to the unavailability of fresh blood during critical moments. Key features include an emergency blood search, donor registration, and an optional login for seekers. Rokto focuses on providing fresh blood by directly connecting seekers with nearby donors, ensuring faster response times. The platform is fully responsive and easy to use across devices, ensuring accessibility for everyone, even in urgent situations. The project is driven by the belief that timely access to fresh blood can save countless lives. Rokto is not just a platform; it's a mission to create a community of life-savers.
